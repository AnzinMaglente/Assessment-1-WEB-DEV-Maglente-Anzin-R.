        <h3>Plot:</h3>
        <br>Christopher Robin (Ewan McGregor) is leaving for boarding school, so his friends from the Hundred Acre Wood - Winnie the Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga, Roo, Owl, and Rabbit - throw a goodbye party. Christopher comforts Pooh and tells him that he will never forget him.
        <br><br>
        Christopher goes to boarding school, after which he grows up, meets and marries architect Evelyn (Hayley Atwell), with whom he has daughter, Madeline (Bronte Carmichael). He serves in the British Army during World War II. After the war, he works as an efficiency expert at Winslow Luggage. He neglects his family due to his demanding job and plans on sending Madeline to boarding school. With the company hitting hard times, Giles Winslow Jr. (Mark Gatiss) tells Christopher to decrease expenditures by 20%, largely by choosing which employees to lay off, and to present his plan on Monday. This causes Christopher to reluctantly miss joining his family at their countryside cottage in Sussex for a summer-ending weekend.
        <br><br>
        When Pooh awakens and is unable to find his friends, he decides to travel through Christopher's door and finds himself in London. He reunites with Christopher, who is shocked to see Pooh, but takes him back to his London home. After a night and morning of chaos (including Pooh knocking down all of his kitchen shelves in search of honey), Christopher escorts the bear back to Sussex on the next train.
        <br><br>
        After sneaking past Christopher's cottage, the two enter the Hundred Acre Wood. Christopher becomes exasperated by Pooh's absent-mindedness and fear of Heffalumps and Woozles, and angrily tells Pooh that he is not a child anymore, before the two get separated in the fog. After falling into a "Heffalump Trap", which is then flooded by rainfall, soaking him and his belongings, Christopher discovers Eeyore and Piglet, who lead him to the others, hiding in a log out of fear of a Heffalump. Unable to persuade his friends that he is truly Christopher Robin, he pretends to defeat a Heffalump to convince them. Finally believing that it is Christopher Robin, they joyfully greet him. When they reunite with Pooh at their meeting spot, Christopher apologizes for getting upset earlier. Christopher tells Pooh how lost he feels, but Pooh reminds him that they have found each other and comforts him with a hug.
        <br><br>
        The next morning, Christopher, realizing how late he is, rushes from the Hundred Acre Wood to make his presentation. He encounters his family and, unable to tell them about his old friends in the Hundred Acre Wood, leaves. Pooh realizes that Tigger removed Christopher's important paperwork when drying his briefcase, so Pooh, Tigger, Piglet and Eeyore decide to travel to London to give it back. They meet Madeline, who recognizes them from her father's drawings. She joins them, wanting to dissuade her father about boarding school; Evelyn follows after discovering a note Madeline left.
        <br><br>
        At the meeting, Christopher discovers that his papers are not in his briefcase, which contains items from the woods that Tigger left for him. Evelyn arrives and Christopher joins her to search for Madeline. Madeline's group stow away in Winslow company crates, but Tigger, Eeyore and Piglet are accidentally thrown out, and they encounter Christopher and Evelyn in the process. Madeline and Pooh arrive near the Winslow building and reunite with Christopher's group, but Madeline accidentally trips on the stairs and loses all but one of the papers, upsetting her and Pooh. Christopher assures Madeline of her importance to him and that he will not send her to boarding school.
        <br><br>
        Christopher improvises a plan involving reducing the prices of luggage, giving employees paid leave, and selling their luggage to everyday people to increase demand. Winslow Jr. dismisses the idea, but his father, Winslow Sr. warms to it and agrees to the plan. Winslow Jr. is humiliated as Christopher points out that he contributed nothing to the plan, having been golfing all weekend.
        <br><br>
        Christopher finally takes his family into the Hundred Acre Wood to meet the rest of his friends. In a mid-credits scene, the employees of Winslow's are seen having fun at the beach while Richard M. Sherman performs "Busy Doing Nothing" on a piano. Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore and Tigger are relaxing on beach chairs with Eeyore saying, "Thank you for noticing me".
