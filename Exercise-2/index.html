<!-- 
One-page website ☑️
Pick a television series, film or game and design a really simple one-page website (just text, no images). Your website should include:
    - An overview of the plot, key information, cast and/or creative team, characters and any reviews you can find.
    - A nav bar at the top which allows the user to quickly navigate to sections further down the page (anchor Ids).
    - A link to the actual website of the film/game etc. which opens in a new tab when clicked.
    - Use of an external CSS file to style elements creatively (avoid inline styling and use classes instead).
    - At least two classes.
    - One link styled as a button.

Multi-page website (Bonus - Optional)
Using the one-page website you created, clone it into a new directory and split the information down into a simple multi-page website.

An individual page for: plot, key information, cast and/or creative team, characters and any reviews you can find.
Put your new pages in a subdirectory called "pages".
Ensure that each page has a navigation bar.

        <h4>Nostalgia</h4>

        "Christopher Robin got next to zero marketing and had little buzz surrounding its release. It's almost as if Disney wanted to put their efforts elsewhere because they weren't sure on who to market the film to. Well, to their credit, that's exactly how the movie felt to me. A mixture of adult themes with characters acting to cater towards children is a difficult line to market to. Especially since it's almost impossible to define who the actual target audience would be, even after I've seen it. Even with that said, I really adored this film. Full of nostalgia from familiar voices to just the satisfying feeling of watching a old fashioned Disney story unfold in live action form. Winnie the Pooh is an all-time great character in the Disney lore and he is beyond perfect in this film, with Jim Cummings returning to do voiceover once again. Does it take a little bit to get going? Sure, but it finishes with dazzle. The magic of Christopher Robin and the Hundred Acre Wood is absolutely back.

        <h4>It was great to relive my childhood...</h4>

        "This was the first movie in ages where they did not focus on a romantic relationship but rather exploring relationships between friendship and family. Though, I do believe that the movie isn't suiting for very young viewers. As it might seem boring to them or rather the message conveyed isn't about them. Christopher Robin forgets about being happy due to his workaholic nature, this could really relate more to high school, college or working people. But, overall it's a great movie! It's great for laughs, reminiscing and a little tears"

        <h4>Truly Great</h4>
        muvbuff-4573717 - August 2018
        <br><br>
        "Christopher Robin is a truly great and heartwarming film about the importance of family and friends on one's life. Not only written incredibly well and acted perfectly, the film has a lot of realism to it, even with talking stuffed animals as part of the cast. Blending very real everyday hardships with fantasy gives the film a contrasting look at how bleak the world is when we don't realize what is truly important and tells us to remember our childhoods and try to be a better parent by being a kid with your kids. Overall, the film displays a heartfelt message with a cast of fun characters from an iconic series and does so very well and I suggest you go out and see this movie.
