    - A field for the user to enter the number of liters purchased. This should have a default value of 0
    - A button that when clicked calculates the total cost of the petrol purchased and displays the result to the screen
    - A p tag to display the total cost
    - Comments throughout every file.
    - Buttons should include hover effects, and fields should clearly "focus" when in use.
    - Clean and professional creative styling.

            The <label> tag defines a label for several elements such as input.
            
            The <input> tag allows users to input a value, whether from number, text, 
            or etc. It can have various properties such as the ones used here:
                type - specifies what value needs to be inputed.
                value - sets a default value.
                placeholder - normally used to direct users on what input in the box.
                min - the minimum value that can be inputted.
                max - the maximum value that can be inputted.
                readonly - makes it so that users cannot change the value inside the 
                input box.
